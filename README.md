In this project, I created a web application using Express.js to manage three essential pages: Home, Our Services, and Contact Us. The application includes:

Navigation: Each page has a navigation bar linking to the other pages (Home, Our Services, Contact Us).
Working Hours Restriction: A custom middleware ensures that the web application is only accessible during working hours (Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM).
Templating: EJS was used as the template engine to dynamically render HTML pages.
CSS Styling: The pages were styled using custom CSS to enhance the user experience and design.
This project demonstrates how to use Express for routing, middleware for time-based access control, and EJS for dynamic page rendering, along with styling the pages with CSS to create a fully functional web application.
